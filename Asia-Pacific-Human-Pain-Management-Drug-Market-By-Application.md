Additionally, advancements in pain management therapies, such as opioid and non-opioid analgesics, as well as regional anesthesia, have contributed to a steady rise in drug utilization in hospitals throughout Asia Pacific. In retail pharmacies, human pain management drugs are widely accessible to consumers for self-medication and over-the-counter use.
